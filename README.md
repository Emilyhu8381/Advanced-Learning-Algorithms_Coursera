# Advanced-Learning-Algorithms_Coursera
This includes the practice lab assignments in the Jupyter notebook for the Advanced Learning Algorithms course. The objectives of the course are to learn about how to build a neural network using the TensorFlow framework and then use them for (binary and multiclass) classification tasks; train a model in TensorFlow and learn about different activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU, and linear); use the decision tree learning algorithm to make predictions, learn about how decision tree learns from training data, and learn about variations of the decision tree, including random forests and boosted trees.
